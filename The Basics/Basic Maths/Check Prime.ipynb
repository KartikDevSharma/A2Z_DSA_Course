    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible by exactly 2 integers, 1 and the number itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a number **'n'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find out whether **'n'** is prime or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `n` = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** YES\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "5 is only divisible by 1 and 5. 2, 3, and 4 do not divide 5.\n",

    "#### Explanation of Sample Input 3:\n",
    "1 is divisible only by 1, having only one factor. Therefore, it is not a prime number. 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a number \\( n \\) is prime or not efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Checks**: \n",
    "   - If \\( n \\) is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime.\n",
    "   - If \\( n \\) equals 2 or 3, it's prime (since these are the smallest prime numbers).\n",
    "   - If \\( n \\) is even and greater than 2, it's not prime.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Efficient Division Check**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through potential divisors from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n",
    "   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any number in this range (excluding 1 and \\( n \\) itself), then \\( n \\) is not prime.\n",
    "   - This is because, if \\( n \\) can be divided evenly by a number greater than 1 and less than \\( n \\), then it fails the prime definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Only iterate up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) because if \\( n \\) has a divisor larger than \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), it must also have a corresponding divisor smaller than \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n",
    "### PYTHON\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "n = int(input())\n",
    "\n",
    "is_prime = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if n <= 1:\n",
    "    is_prime = False\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n",
    "        if n % i == 0:\n",
    "            is_prime = False\n",
    "            break\n",
    "\n",
    "if is_prime:\n",
    "    print(\"YES\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"NO\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Handling**:\n",
    "   - `n = int(input())`: Reads an integer input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prime Check Logic**:\n",
    "   - `is_prime = True`: Initializes a boolean variable to track if the number is prime.\n",
    "   - Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, `is_prime` is set to `False`.\n",
    "   - Iterates through potential divisors from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If `n` is divisible by any of these divisors, `is_prime` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   - If `is_prime` is `True` after the loop, it prints \"YES\", indicating that `n` is a prime number.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, it prints \"NO\", indicating that `n` is not a prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code correctly determines if the input number `n` is prime based on the efficient primality check up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). Adjustments were made to ensure compatibility with typical input and output handling in Python environments.\n",

    "### Java Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.*;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class PrimeChecker {\n",
    "    public static String isPrime(int n) {\n",
    "        if (n <= 1) {\n",
    "            return \"NO\";\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        if (n <= 3) {\n",
    "            return \"YES\";\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) {\n",
    "            return \"NO\";\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        int i = 5;\n",
    "        while (i * i <= n) {\n",
    "            if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) {\n",
    "                return \"NO\";\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            i += 6;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return \"YES\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n",
    "        int n = sc.nextInt();\n",
    "        System.out.println(isPrime(n));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Java Solution**: \n",
    "  - Similar logic to the Python solution but implemented in Java.\n",
    "  - Uses a `Scanner` to read input and a function `isPrime` to determine if a number is prime, returning \"NO\" or \"YES\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These solutions efficiently determine the primality of \\( n \\) using the optimized approach with a time complexity of \\( O(\\sqrt{n}) \\), suitable for large values of \\( n \\) up to \\( 10^9 \\)."

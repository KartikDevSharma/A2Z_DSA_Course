    "1. Store the bits representation of 'N' into an array.\n",
    "2. Create a variable 'i' = 0 to iterate through 16 bits of given integer 'N'.\n",
    "3. Iterate through 16 bits and, in each iteration:\n",
    "   - Find the ith bit of the given integer.\n",
    "   - Find the (31 - i)th bit of the given integer\n",
    "   - Swap both these two bits.\n",
    "   - Increment 'i' by one.\n",
    "4. Change this bits representation into an unsigned integer.\n",
    "5. Return the modified integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",

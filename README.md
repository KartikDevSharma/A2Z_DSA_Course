# DSA Practice

Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet! This journey has been an exciting and challenging learning experience, allowing me to sharpen my problem-solving skills and dive deep into the world of DSA.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following main folders:


 Step 1: Learn the basics

 Step 2: Learn Important Sorting Techniques

 Step 3: Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy -> Medium -> Hard]

 Step 4: Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]

 Step 5: Strings [Basic and Medium]

 Step 6: Learn LinkedList [Single LL, Double LL, Medium, Hard Problems]

 Step 7: Recursion [PatternWise]

 Step 8: Bit Manipulation [Concepts & Problems]

 Step 9: Stack and Queues [Learning, Pre-In-Post-fix, Monotonic Stack, Implementation]

 Step 10: Sliding Window & Two Pointer Combined Problems

 Step 11: Heaps [Learning, Medium, Hard Problems]

 Step 12: Greedy Algorithms [Easy, Medium/Hard]

 Step 13: Binary Trees [Traversals, Medium and Hard Problems]

 Step 14: Binary Search Trees [Concept and Problems]

 Step 15: Graphs [Concepts & Problems]

 Step 16: Dynamic Programming [Patterns and Problems]

 Step 17: Tries

 Step 18: Strings


## Problem Statements and Approaches

For each problem, I have included the problem statement along with the corresponding problem link. Additionally, I have provided detailed explanations of the approaches and solutions used, showcasing both Java and Python implementations.


## Motivation

My primary goal with this repository is to share my learning journey and hopefully assist others who are embarking on a similar path. By providing comprehensive solutions, explanations, and highlighting common pitfalls, I hope to make the learning process more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a record of my personal solutions, contributions and suggestions are always welcome. If you spot any errors or have alternative solutions that could enhance the learning experience, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to [Striver](https://www.youtube.com/c/takeUforward) for curating the A2Z DSA Sheet, which has been an invaluable resource throughout this journey. Their dedication to providing high-quality educational content has been instrumental in my learning process.

Happy coding, and may your journey through the world of DSA be enriching and rewarding!

# A2Z DSA Course

Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet! This journey has been an exciting and challenging learning experience, allowing me to sharpen my problem-solving skills and dive deep into the world of DSA.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **Leetcode**: This folder contains solutions to problems found on LeetCode.
2. **Coding Ninjas (Naukri.com)**: This folder houses solutions to problems from the Coding Ninjas platform, now known as Naukri.com. The solutions are provided in a single Python file in Markdown format for better readability and understanding.

## Problem Statements and Approaches

For each problem, I have included the problem statement along with the corresponding problem link. Additionally, I have provided detailed explanations of the approaches and solutions used, showcasing both Java and Python implementations.

Since it had been a while since I worked with Java, I encountered some silly syntax mistakes along the way. To help others who might face similar challenges, I have clearly highlighted the differences in syntax between the Java and Python codes used in the problems.

## Motivation

My primary goal with this repository is to share my learning journey and hopefully assist others who are embarking on a similar path. By providing comprehensive solutions, explanations, and highlighting common pitfalls, I hope to make the learning process more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a record of my personal solutions, contributions and suggestions are always welcome. If you spot any errors or have alternative solutions that could enhance the learning experience, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to [Striver](https://www.youtube.com/c/takeUforward) for curating the A2Z DSA Sheet, which has been an invaluable resource throughout this journey. Their dedication to providing high-quality educational content has been instrumental in my learning process.

Happy coding, and may your journey through the world of DSA be enriching and rewarding!

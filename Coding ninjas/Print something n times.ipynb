    "## Recursion Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of recursion is that we call smaller versions of the given problem. We can make a function `recursiveFunction('n', 'ans')`. This function will add the text \"Coding Ninjas\" to the list 'ans' 'n' times. What can be the smaller version of this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to add 'n' times. So we can add it once and then add it 'n' - 1 times by calling the function `recursiveFunction('n' - 1, 'ans')`. This will add the text remaining 'n' - 1 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will be the base case? The function call `recursiveFunction(0)` will add the text 0 times, which is equivalent to not adding anything. So we will terminate the function when 'n' = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The steps are as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "void recursiveFunction(int 'n', list 'ans')\n",
    "1. If 'n' = 0 then return/terminate the current function call.\n",
    "2. Add \"Coding Ninjas\" in 'ans'.\n",
    "3. Call the function recursiveFunction('n' - 1, 'ans').\n",
    "\n",
    "void printNTimes(int 'n')\n",
    "1. Let 'ans' be a list.\n",
    "2. Call recursiveFunction('n', 'ans').\n",
    "3. Return 'ans'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity**\n",
    "**O(n), where 'n' is the given integer.**\n",
    "We are making 'n' function calls to `recursiveFunction()`.\n",
    "**Hence, the time complexity is O(n).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity**\n",
    "**O(n), where 'n' is the given integer.**\n",
    "In recursion, there is a function call before the previous function ends. So each function will consume its own space in the stack.\n",
    "**Hence, the space complexity is O(n).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Java Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.*;\n",
    "import java.util.List;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Solution {\n",
    "    static List<String> l=new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "    public static List<String> printNtimes(int n){\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Write your code here.\n",
    "        if(n==0)\n",
    "            return l;\n",
    "        l.add(\"Coding Ninjas\");\n",
    "        n--;\n",
    "        return printNtimes(n);\n",
    "\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String args[]){\n",
    "        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);\n",
    "        System.out.println(printNtimes(sc.nextInt()));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java solution follows the recursion approach outlined above. The `printNtimes` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of strings containing \"Coding Ninjas\" printed `n` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case is when `n` is 0, where the function simply returns the empty list `l`. Otherwise, the function adds \"Coding Ninjas\" to the list `l`, decrements `n` by 1, and recursively calls `printNtimes` with the updated value of `n`. The recursive calls continue until `n` becomes 0, at which point the function starts returning the populated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import *\n",
    "\n",
    "def printNtimes(n: int) -> List[str]:\n",
    "    x = []\n",
    "    if n==0:\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "    x = printNtimes(n-1)\n",
    "    x.append(\"Coding Ninjas\")\n",
    "    return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python solution also follows the same recursion approach as the Java solution. The `printNtimes` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of strings containing \"Coding Ninjas\" printed `n` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case is when `n` is 0, where the function returns an empty list `x`. Otherwise, the function recursively calls `printNtimes` with `n-1` and appends \"Coding Ninjas\" to the resulting list. The recursive calls continue until `n` becomes 0, at which point the function starts returning the populated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Java and Python solutions use the same recursion approach and correctly implement the desired functionality of printing \"Coding Ninjas\" `n` times without using a loop."

    "Certainly. Let's break down this function step by step, starting with what we want to print, then examining the full code, and finally providing a detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to print:\n",
    "We want to print a pattern of stars where each row consists of 5 stars, and this pattern is repeated for a specified number of rows. The desired output for 5 rows would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "* * * * *\n",
    "* * * * *\n",
    "* * * * *\n",
    "* * * * *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the full code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def repeated_star_pattern(rows):\n",
    "    for i in range(1, rows + 1):\n",
    "        print('* ' * 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "repeated_star_pattern(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def repeated_star_pattern(rows):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line defines a function named `repeated_star_pattern`.\n",
    "   - It takes one parameter `rows`, which determines how many rows of stars to print.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The For Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(1, rows + 1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a loop that will iterate `rows` number of times.\n",
    "   - `range(1, rows + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `rows` (inclusive).\n",
    "   - If `rows` is 5, this generates the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n",
    "   - We use `rows + 1` as the upper bound because `range()` is exclusive of its upper bound.\n",
    "   - The variable `i` will take on each value in this sequence, though we don't actually use `i` in the loop body.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Printing the Stars:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print('* ' * 5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line is the body of the for loop and is executed in each iteration.\n",
    "   - `'* '` is a string containing a star and a space.\n",
    "   - `* 5` is string multiplication, which repeats the string 5 times.\n",
    "   - So `'* ' * 5` creates the string `'* * * * * '`.\n",
    "   - The `print()` function outputs this string and automatically moves to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function Call:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   repeated_star_pattern(5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line calls our function, passing 5 as the argument.\n",
    "   - This means our pattern will have 5 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When Python encounters the function definition, it stores the function but doesn't execute its body yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When `repeated_star_pattern(5)` is called:\n",
    "   - Python creates a new local scope for the function.\n",
    "   - It assigns the value 5 to the parameter `rows`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `for` loop begins:\n",
    "   - It sets up an iterator using `range(1, 6)`.\n",
    "   - For each iteration:\n",
    "     - It executes `print('* ' * 5)`, which prints five stars and moves to a new line.\n",
    "     - Even though we define `i`, we don't use it in the loop body. It's just controlling the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This process repeats 5 times, creating 5 identical rows of 5 stars each.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After the loop completes, the function ends and control returns to the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates several key concepts:\n",
    "- Function definition and calling\n",
    "- Loop constructs (for loop with range)\n",
    "- String multiplication\n",
    "- The use of loops to repeat actions (in this case, printing a line multiple times)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity of this function comes from the fact that each row is identical, so we don't need nested loops or to vary the output based on the row number. We just repeat the same print statement a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def star_pattern(rows):\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line defines a function named `star_pattern` that takes one parameter, `rows`. This parameter determines how many rows of stars the pattern will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the core of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, rows + 1):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a `for` loop, which is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `range(1, rows + 1)`:\n",
    "   - The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "   - It takes two arguments here: a start value (1) and a stop value (rows + 1).\n",
    "   - The sequence includes the start value but excludes the stop value.\n",
    "   - So if `rows` is 5, this generates the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `for i in ...`:\n",
    "   - This assigns each value from the range, one by one, to the variable `i`.\n",
    "   - `i` is often used as a conventional name for loop variables, short for \"index\" or \"iterator\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why `rows + 1`?\n",
    "   - We use `rows + 1` as the stop value because `range()` doesn't include the stop value in its sequence.\n",
    "   - If we want 5 rows, we need the sequence to go up to 5, so we use 6 (5 + 1) as the stop value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the body of the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print('* ' * i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line is executed for each value of `i`. Here's what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `'* '`: This is a string containing a star and a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `* i`: This is string multiplication. It repeats the string `'* '` `i` times.\n",
    "   - For example, if `i` is 3, it creates the string `'* * * '`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `print()`: This function prints the resulting string to the console and then moves to a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this plays out for each iteration when `rows` is 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When `i` is 1: Prints `'* '`\n",
    "- When `i` is 2: Prints `'* * '`\n",
    "- When `i` is 3: Prints `'* * * '`\n",
    "- When `i` is 4: Prints `'* * * * '`\n",
    "- When `i` is 5: Prints `'* * * * * '`\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a triangle pattern of stars, with each row having one more star than the previous row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "star_pattern(5)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def number_pattern(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This defines a function named `number_pattern` that takes one parameter `N`.\n",
    "   - `N` determines the number of rows in our pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(1, N + 1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This loop controls the rows of our pattern.\n",
    "   - `range(1, N + 1)` generates a sequence from 1 to N (inclusive).\n",
    "   - If N is 6, this generates [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\n",
    "   - `i` will take each of these values in turn, representing the current row number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inner Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This loop controls how many times we print the row number.\n",
    "   - `range(i)` generates a sequence from 0 to i-1.\n",
    "   - For example, when i is 3, this generates [0, 1, 2].\n",
    "   - We don't actually use the value of `j`; it's just controlling the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Printing the Number:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(i, end=' ')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This prints the current row number (`i`).\n",
    "   - `end=' '` tells Python to use a space instead of a newline after each number.\n",
    "   - This allows us to print all numbers in a row on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. New Line After Each Row:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",

    "Here's the full code to achieve this pattern:\n",
    "\n",

    "        print('* ' * i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "N = 6\n",
    "star_pattern(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def star_pattern(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This defines a function named `star_pattern` that takes one parameter `N`.\n",
    "   - `N` determines the number of stars in the first row and the total number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The For Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(N, 0, -1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a loop that will iterate `N` times, but in reverse order.\n",
    "   - `range(N, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `N` to 1 (inclusive), decreasing by 1 each time.\n",
    "   - If `N` is 6, this generates the sequence [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].\n",
    "   - The `-1` as the third argument in `range()` specifies the step, making it count down instead of up.\n",
    "   - The variable `i` will take on each value in this sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Printing the Stars:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print('* ' * i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line is the body of the for loop and is executed in each iteration.\n",
    "   - `'* '` is a string containing a star and a space.\n",
    "   - `* i` is string multiplication, which repeats the string `i` times.\n",
    "   - So `'* ' * i` creates a string with `i` stars, each followed by a space.\n",
    "   - The `print()` function outputs this string and automatically moves to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When Python encounters the function definition, it stores the function but doesn't execute its body yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When `star_pattern(6)` is called:\n",
    "   - Python creates a new local scope for the function.\n",
    "   - It assigns the value 6 to the parameter `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `for` loop begins:\n",
    "   - It sets up an iterator using `range(6, 0, -1)`.\n",
    "   - For each iteration:\n",
    "     - It multiplies the string `'* '` by the current value of `i`.\n",
    "     - It prints the resulting string of stars.\n",
    "     - The `print()` function automatically moves to the next line after each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This process repeats 6 times, creating 6 rows with decreasing numbers of stars:\n",
    "   - First iteration (i = 6): Prints 6 stars\n",
    "   - Second iteration (i = 5): Prints 5 stars\n",
    "   - Third iteration (i = 4): Prints 4 stars\n",
    "   - Fourth iteration (i = 3): Prints 3 stars\n",
    "   - Fifth iteration (i = 2): Prints 2 stars\n",
    "   - Sixth iteration (i = 1): Prints 1 star\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After the loop completes, the function ends and control returns to the main program.\n",
    "\n",

    "We need to print an inverted pyramid pattern of stars. The pattern starts with a full row of stars at the top and decreases by two stars in each subsequent row, while the spaces on the left increase by one in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the full code to achieve this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def inverted_star_pyramid(rows):\n",
    "    for i in range(rows):\n",
    "        # Print leading spaces\n",
    "        print(' ' * i, end='')\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Print stars\n",
    "        print('*' * (2 * (rows - i) - 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "inverted_star_pyramid(6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def inverted_star_pyramid(rows):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This defines a function named `inverted_star_pyramid` that takes one parameter `rows`.\n",
    "   - `rows` determines the height of the inverted pyramid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Main Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(rows):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a loop that will iterate `rows` number of times.\n",
    "   - `range(rows)` generates a sequence from 0 to `rows-1`.\n",
    "   - The variable `i` represents the current row number (starting from 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Printing Leading Spaces:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(' ' * i, end='')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This prints the spaces before the stars in each row.\n",
    "   - `i` directly gives us the number of spaces needed for each row.\n",
    "   - As `i` increases, the number of spaces increases.\n",
    "   - `end=''` prevents moving to a new line after printing the spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Printing Stars:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print('*' * (2 * (rows - i) - 1))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This prints the stars for each row.\n",
    "   - `2 * (rows - i) - 1` calculates the number of stars needed for the current row.\n",
    "   - The first row (i=0) has `2 * rows - 1` stars, and this number decreases by 2 for each subsequent row.\n",
    "   - We don't need `end=''` here because we want to move to the next line after printing the stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When `inverted_star_pyramid(6)` is called:\n",
    "   - Python creates a new local scope for the function.\n",
    "   - It assigns the value 6 to the parameter `rows`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `for` loop begins:\n",
    "   - It sets up an iterator using `range(6)`, which generates [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n",
    "   - For each iteration:\n",
    "     a. It prints the leading spaces (increasing with each row).\n",
    "     b. It calculates and prints the stars (decreasing with each row).\n",
    "     c. It automatically moves to the next line after printing the stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let's see how this works for each iteration when rows is 6:\n",
    "   - First iteration (i = 0): 0 spaces, 11 stars\n",
    "   - Second iteration (i = 1): 1 space, 9 stars\n",
    "   - Third iteration (i = 2): 2 spaces, 7 stars\n",
    "   - Fourth iteration (i = 3): 3 spaces, 5 stars\n",
    "   - Fifth iteration (i = 4): 4 spaces, 3 stars\n",
    "   - Sixth iteration (i = 5): 5 spaces, 1 star\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates several key concepts:\n",
    "- Function definition and calling\n",
    "- Loop constructs (for loop with range)\n",
    "- String multiplication for repeating characters\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations to calculate spaces and stars\n",
    "- Using `end=''` in `print()` to control line breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "The elegance of this solution lies in how it uses a single loop to handle both the increasing spaces and decreasing stars. The calculations `i` for spaces and `2 * (rows - i) - 1` for stars ensure that the inverted pyramid shape is maintained as we move down the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `i` directly for spaces simplifies the leading space calculation, while the star calculation neatly ensures an odd number of stars in each row, maintaining the pyramid shape. This approach creates an efficient and readable solution to generating the inverted star pyramid pattern.\n",

    "1. Function Definition:\n",

    "   - This defines a function named `print_diamond` that takes one parameter `n`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. When `print_right_triangle(6)` is called:\n",
    "   - Python creates a local scope for the function.\n",
    "   - It assigns the value 6 to the parameter `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first `for` loop (Increasing Triangle) begins:\n",
    "   - It iterates 6 times (1 to 6).\n",
    "   - For each iteration:\n",
    "     a. It prints 5 spaces for right alignment.\n",
    "     b. It prints `i` stars, where `i` increases from 1 to 6.\n",
    "   - This creates rows with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The second `for` loop (Decreasing Triangle) begins:\n",
    "   - It iterates 5 times (5 to 1).\n",
    "   - For each iteration:\n",
    "     a. It prints 5 spaces for right alignment.\n",
    "     b. It prints `i` stars, where `i` decreases from 5 to 1.\n",
    "   - This creates rows with 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The complete sequence for a 6-star maximum triangle:\n",
    "   - Increasing: 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars, 6 stars\n",
    "   - Decreasing: 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates several key concepts:\n",
    "- Function definition and parameter usage\n",
    "- String multiplication for spaces and stars\n",
    "- Two separate loops for the increasing and decreasing parts of the triangle\n",
    "- Use of `range()` with different parameters to count up and down\n",
    "- Right alignment using a fixed number of leading spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity and symmetry. By using similar formulas for both the increasing and decreasing parts, we create a balanced right-aligned triangle pattern. The code is concise yet readable, efficiently generating the pattern with just two loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `' ' * 5` for right alignment ensures that all rows start at the same position, creating the desired right-aligned effect. This approach creates an efficient and visually appealing solution to generating the right-aligned triangle pattern.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def pattern11(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This defines a function named `pattern11` that takes one parameter `N`, which represents the number of rows in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `N` times, where `i` goes from 0 to N-1. Each iteration of this loop represents one row of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determining the Starting Digit:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   start = 1 if i % 2 == 0 else 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line determines whether each row should start with 1 or 0.\n",
    "   - If `i` is even (i % 2 == 0), `start` is set to 1.\n",
    "   - If `i` is odd, `start` is set to 0.\n",
    "   This ensures that even-indexed rows (0, 2, 4, ...) start with 1, and odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5, ...) start with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inner Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i + 1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `i + 1` times for each row. This is because the number of digits in each row is equal to its row number plus one (row 0 has 1 digit, row 1 has 2 digits, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing the Pattern:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(start, end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This prints the current value of `start` (either 0 or 1) without moving to a new line (because of `end=\"\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Toggling the Digit:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   start = 1 - start\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line toggles the value of `start` between 0 and 1:\n",
    "   - If `start` is 1, it becomes 0 (1 - 1 = 0)\n",
    "   - If `start` is 0, it becomes 1 (1 - 0 = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Moving to the Next Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After each row is printed, this empty `print()` moves the cursor to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Main Execution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       N = 6\n",
    "       pattern11(N)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This part ensures that the function is called only if the script is run directly (not imported as a module). It sets `N` to 6 and calls the `pattern11` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting pattern for N = 6 would look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "01\n",
    "101\n",
    "0101\n",
    "10101\n",
    "010101\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "- The outer loop (`i`) controls the number of rows.\n",
    "- The inner loop (`j`) controls the number of digits in each row.\n",
    "- The starting digit alternates between 1 and 0 for each row.\n",
    "- Within each row, the digits alternate between 1 and 0.\n",
    "- The number of digits in each row increases by 1 as we move down.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates the use of nested loops, conditional statements, and a clever way to toggle between two values (0 and 1) to create a specific pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a shorter and more concise version of the pattern generation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pattern11(N):\n",
    "    for i in range(N):\n",
    "        # Generate the pattern using a comprehension and join to make a single string\n",
    "        print(\"\".join(str((i + j) % 2) for j in range(i + 1)))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main execution\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    N = 6  # We need 6 rows to match the desired output\n",
    "    pattern11(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **For loop to iterate through rows (`i`)**:\n",
    "   - The loop runs from `0` to `N-1` (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List comprehension within `print`**:\n",
    "   - `str((i + j) % 2)`: Calculate the value for each position using the sum of the row index (`i`) and the column index (`j`), then take modulo 2 to alternate between 0 and 1.\n",
    "   - `for j in range(i + 1)`: Iterate through columns from `0` to `i` (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Join and print**:\n",
    "   - `\"\".join(...)`: Join the generated list of characters into a single string and print it.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   We define a function named `number_pattern` that takes one parameter `N`, which represents the number of rows in the pattern.\n",

    "2. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(1, N + 1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `N` times, with `i` going from 1 to N (inclusive). Each iteration of this loop represents one row of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Left Part of the Pattern:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(1, i + 1):\n",
    "       print(j, end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This inner loop prints numbers from 1 to `i` (the current row number).\n",
    "   - In the first row, it prints just 1.\n",
    "   - In the second row, it prints 1 and 2.\n",
    "   - And so on, up to the last row where it prints 1 to N.\n",
    "   The `end=\"\"` parameter in `print()` prevents moving to a new line after each number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Spaces in the Middle:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(2 * (N - i)):\n",
    "       print(\" \", end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints the spaces between the left and right parts of the pattern.\n",
    "   - The number of spaces is `2 * (N - i)`.\n",
    "   - In the first row, it prints `2 * (N - 1)` spaces.\n",
    "   - The number of spaces decreases by 2 in each subsequent row.\n",
    "   - In the last row, no spaces are printed (2 * (N - N) = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Right Part of the Pattern:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n",
    "       print(j, end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints numbers from `i` down to 1.\n",

    "   - In the second row, it prints 2 and 1.\n",
    "   - And so on, up to the last row where it prints N down to 1.\n",
    "   The third argument `-1` in `range()` makes it count backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. New Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After printing each row, this moves to a new line for the next row.\n",

    "       number_pattern(N)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This part ensures the function is called only if the script is run directly. It sets `N` to 6 and calls the `number_pattern` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "- The pattern is symmetrical, with numbers increasing from left to right in the first half, and decreasing in the second half.\n",
    "- The number of digits on each side increases with each row, while the number of spaces in the middle decreases.\n",
    "- The maximum number in each row is equal to the row number.\n",

    "3. How to generate sequences both forwards and backwards\n",
    "4. How to calculate and print varying numbers of spaces to align pattern elements\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break this down in utmost detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def number_pattern(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We define a function named `number_pattern` that takes one parameter `N`, which represents the number of rows in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initializing the Current Number:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   current_number = 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We start with 1 as our first number to be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(1, N + 1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `N` times, with `i` going from 1 to N (inclusive). Each iteration of this loop represents one row of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inner Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This inner loop runs `i` times for each row. This is crucial because:\n",
    "   - In the first row (i=1), it runs once\n",
    "   - In the second row (i=2), it runs twice\n",
    "   - And so on, up to the last row where it runs N times\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing Each Number:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(f\"{current_number:2d}\", end=\"  \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line does several things:\n",
    "   - `f\"{current_number:2d}\"` is an f-string that formats `current_number` as a 2-digit integer (`:2d`). This ensures that all numbers, even single-digit ones, take up 2 spaces, maintaining alignment.\n",
    "   - `end=\"  \"` tells Python to end the print statement with two spaces instead of a newline, keeping numbers on the same line within a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Incrementing the Current Number:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   current_number += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After printing each number, we increment `current_number` by 1, preparing it for the next number to be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Moving to the Next Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After the inner loop completes (i.e., after printing all numbers for a row), this empty `print()` moves to the next line, starting a new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Main Execution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       N = 6  # Number of rows\n",
    "       number_pattern(N)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This part ensures the function is called only if the script is run directly. It sets `N` to 6 (for 6 rows) and calls the `number_pattern` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "- The pattern is a triangle where each row has one more number than the previous row.\n",
    "- Numbers are continuous and increasing, not resetting for each row.\n",
    "- The spacing is crucial for proper alignment, especially as numbers get larger (double digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the Scenes:\n",
    "1. Row Control: The outer loop (`i`) controls the number of rows and indirectly controls how many numbers are in each row.\n",
    "2. Number Placement: The inner loop (`j`) is responsible for placing the correct number of elements in each row.\n",
    "3. Continuous Numbering: By using a single `current_number` variable that persists outside the loops, we ensure continuous numbering across rows.\n",
    "4. Formatting: The use of `f\"{current_number:2d}\"` ensures consistent spacing, making the output aligned and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution demonstrates:\n",
    "1. Nested loops for pattern generation\n",
    "2. How to maintain a running count across iterations\n",
    "3. String formatting for alignment\n",
    "4. How to control the flow of printing (using `end=\"  \"` to keep numbers on the same line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this pattern requires visualizing how the number of elements increases in each row and how the continuous numbering flows from one row to the next. The key is in realizing that each row starts with the number that follows the last number of the previous row, creating this seamless increasing pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more concise version of the `number_pattern` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def number_pattern(N):\n",
    "    current_number = 1\n",
    "    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n",
    "        print('  '.join(f\"{current_number + j:2d}\" for j in range(i)))\n",
    "        current_number += i\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main execution\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    N = 6  # Number of rows\n",
    "    number_pattern(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **For loop to iterate through rows (`i`)**:\n",
    "   - The loop runs from `1` to `N` (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print**:\n",
    "   - `print('  '.join(f\"{current_number + j:2d}\" for j in range(i)))`: \n",
    "     - This uses a generator expression to create and join a list of formatted numbers for each row.\n",
    "     - `current_number + j` generates the numbers for the current row.\n",
    "     - `:2d` formats the number to take at least two spaces.\n",
    "     - `'  '.join(...)` joins the formatted numbers with two spaces between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update current number**:\n",
    "   - `current_number += i`: \n",
    "     - This updates the `current_number` to the starting number for the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach eliminates the inner loop and uses a generator expression with `join` for more concise and readable code.\n",

    "   This inner loop runs `i + 1` times for each row. This is crucial because:\n",

    "4. Converting Number to Letter:\n",

    "   letter = chr(65 + j)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line does the magic of converting a number to its corresponding uppercase letter:\n",
    "   - In ASCII and Unicode, uppercase letters start at code point 65 (for 'A')\n",
    "   - We add `j` (which goes from 0 to i) to 65\n",
    "   - `chr()` function converts this number back to its character representation\n",
    "   - So, when j=0, we get 'A', when j=1, we get 'B', and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing Each Letter:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(letter, end=\" \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This prints the letter followed by a space:\n",
    "   - The `end=\" \"` parameter tells Python to use a space instead of a newline after printing each letter\n",
    "   - This keeps all letters of a row on the same line\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Moving to the Next Line:\n",

    "    letter_triangle_pattern(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break this down in utmost detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def letter_triangle_pattern(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We define a function named `letter_triangle_pattern` that takes one parameter `N`, which represents the number of rows in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `N` times, with `i` going from 0 to N-1. Each iteration of this loop represents one row of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Converting Row Number to Letter:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   letter = chr(65 + i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line is crucial for getting the correct letter for each row:\n",
    "   - 65 is the ASCII code for 'A'\n",
    "   - We add `i` (which goes from 0 to N-1) to 65\n",
    "   - `chr()` function converts this number back to its character representation\n",
    "   - So, when i=0, we get 'A', when i=1, we get 'B', and so on\n",
    "   - This ensures each row has a different letter\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inner Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i + 1):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This inner loop runs `i + 1` times for each row. This is key because:\n",
    "   - In the first row (i=0), it runs once\n",
    "   - In the second row (i=1), it runs twice\n",
    "   - And so on, up to the last row where it runs N times\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing Each Letter:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(letter, end=\" \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This prints the letter followed by a space:\n",
    "   - We print the same `letter` multiple times in each row\n",
    "   - The `end=\" \"` parameter tells Python to use a space instead of a newline after printing each letter\n",
    "   - This keeps all letters of a row on the same line\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Moving to the Next Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After the inner loop completes (i.e., after printing all letters for a row), this empty `print()` moves to the next line, starting a new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Main Execution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       N = 6  # Number of rows\n",
    "       letter_triangle_pattern(N)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This part ensures the function is called only if the script is run directly. It sets `N` to 6 (for 6 rows) and calls the `letter_triangle_pattern` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "- The pattern is a triangle where each row has one more letter than the previous row.\n",
    "- Each row contains a single letter repeated multiple times.\n",
    "- The letter for each row is determined by the row number (A for first row, B for second, etc.).\n",
    "- The number of times the letter is repeated in each row corresponds to the row number (if we count rows starting from 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the Scenes:\n",
    "1. Row Control: The outer loop (`i`) controls the number of rows and determines which letter to use for each row.\n",
    "2. Letter Repetition: The inner loop (`j`) is responsible for repeating the letter the correct number of times in each row.\n",
    "3. ASCII Magic: We use the ASCII value of 'A' (65) as a starting point and add to it to get subsequent letters for each row.\n",
    "4. Character Conversion: The `chr()` function is key in converting numerical values back to characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution demonstrates:\n",
    "1. Nested loops for pattern generation\n",
    "2. How to convert between numbers and letters using ASCII values\n",
    "3. How to repeat a character a variable number of times\n",
    "4. String formatting and printing control\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this pattern requires visualizing:\n",
    "- How the number of elements increases in each row\n",
    "- How each row uses a different letter\n",
    "- The relationship between the row number, the letter used, and the number of times it's repeated\n",
    "\n",
    "The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity and the clever use of row numbers to determine both the letter to use and how many times to repeat it. By understanding this, you can easily modify the pattern to start with different letters, change the direction, or create more complex letter patterns.\n",

    "   We define a function that takes `N` as a parameter, representing the number of rows in the pyramid.\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `N` times, with `i` going from 0 to N-1. Each iteration represents one row of the pyramid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Printing Leading Spaces:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(N - i - 1):\n",
    "       print(\" \", end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints spaces before the letters in each row:\n",
    "   - It prints `N - i - 1` spaces\n",
    "   - As `i` increases, fewer spaces are printed, creating the pyramid shape\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Printing Ascending Letters:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i + 1):\n",
    "       print(chr(65 + j), end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints the ascending sequence of letters:\n",
    "   - It prints `i + 1` letters in each row\n",
    "   - `chr(65 + j)` converts numbers to letters (A=65, B=66, etc.)\n",
    "   - As `i` increases, more letters are printed\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing Descending Letters:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):\n",
    "       print(chr(65 + j), end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints the descending sequence of letters:\n",
    "   - It starts from `i - 1` and goes down to 0\n",
    "   - This excludes the middle letter to avoid repetition\n",
    "   - As `i` increases, more letters are printed in reverse order\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Printing Trailing Spaces (Optional):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(N - i - 1):\n",
    "       print(\" \", end=\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints spaces after the letters, maintaining symmetry. It's optional for this pattern but can be useful for alignment in some contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Moving to Next Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After printing each row, this moves the cursor to the next line.\n",

    "8. Main Execution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       N = 6  # Number of rows\n",
    "       symmetrical_alphabet_pyramid(N)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This part sets `N` to 6 and calls the function when the script is run directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "- The pattern is symmetrical, with letters ascending on the left and descending on the right.\n",
    "- Each row starts and ends with 'A'.\n",
    "- The middle letter in each row is the highest in the alphabet for that row.\n",
    "- The number of letters in each row increases by 2 with each new row (except the first row).\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the Scenes:\n",
    "1. Pyramid Shape: Achieved by decreasing the number of leading spaces and increasing the number of letters in each row.\n",
    "2. Letter Generation: Uses ASCII values (A=65, B=66, etc.) to generate letters.\n",
    "3. Symmetry: Created by printing ascending letters followed immediately by descending letters.\n",
    "4. Row Length Control: The total width of each row is constant (2*N - 1), maintained by adjusting spaces and letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution demonstrates:\n",
    "1. Nested loops for complex pattern generation\n",
    "2. ASCII manipulation for letter generation\n",
    "3. How to create symmetry in patterns\n",

    "- How the spaces decrease and letters increase with each row\n",
    "- The symmetrical nature of the letter arrangement in each row\n",
    "- The relationship between row number and the highest letter in that row\n",
    "\n",
    "The elegance of this solution lies in its ability to create a complex, symmetrical pattern using relatively simple loops and ASCII manipulation. This approach can be adapted to create various pyramid-shaped patterns with different characters or sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a shorter version of the `symmetrical_alphabet_pyramid` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def symmetrical_alphabet_pyramid(N):\n",
    "    for i in range(N):\n",
    "        # Leading spaces\n",
    "        print(\" \" * (N - i - 1), end=\"\")\n",
    "        # Ascending and descending letters\n",
    "        print(\"\".join(chr(65 + j) for j in range(i + 1)) + \"\".join(chr(65 + j) for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)))\n",

    "    N = 6  # Number of rows\n",
    "    symmetrical_alphabet_pyramid(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leading spaces**:\n",
    "   - `print(\" \" * (N - i - 1), end=\"\")`: This prints the leading spaces for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ascending and descending letters**:\n",
    "   - `print(\"\".join(chr(65 + j) for j in range(i + 1)) + \"\".join(chr(65 + j) for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)))`: \n",
    "     - This uses two generator expressions inside `join` to create the ascending and descending parts of the pyramid for each row.\n",
    "     - The first part generates the ascending letters (`chr(65 + j) for j in range(i + 1)`).\n",
    "     - The second part generates the descending letters (`chr(65 + j) for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`).\n",
    "     - The `+` operator concatenates these two parts together and prints them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of the function is more concise by using generator expressions and avoiding multiple `for` loops for constructing each row.\n",

    "    pattern18(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down this corrected version:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def pattern18(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This function takes `N` as a parameter, representing the number of rows in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop runs `N` times, with `i` going from 0 to N-1. Each iteration represents one row of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculating the Starting Character:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   start_char = chr(ord('A') + N - 1 - i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line calculates the starting character for each row:\n",
    "   - `ord('A')` gives us the ASCII value of 'A' (which is 65)\n",
    "   - We add `N - 1` to get to the last letter of the pattern (e.g., 'E' if N = 5)\n",
    "   - We subtract `i` to move backwards in the alphabet for each row\n",
    "   - `chr()` converts this ASCII value back to a character\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inner Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for ch in range(ord(start_char), ord('A') + N):\n",
    "       print(chr(ch), end=\" \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop prints the characters for each row:\n",
    "   - It starts from the ASCII value of `start_char`\n",
    "   - It goes up to (but not including) `ord('A') + N`\n",
    "   - We convert each ASCII value back to a character with `chr(ch)`\n",
    "   - Each character is printed followed by a space\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Moving to the Next Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After printing all characters for a row, this moves to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Main Execution:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       N = 5  # Number of rows\n",
    "       pattern18(N)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This sets `N` to 5 and calls the `pattern18` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "- The pattern starts with the Nth letter of the alphabet (e.g., 'E' for N=5) and works backwards for the starting letter of each row.\n",
    "- Each row has one more letter than the previous row.\n",
    "- The letters in each row are in ascending order, always ending with the Nth letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Main {\n",
    "   \n",
    "   static void pattern18(int N)\n",
    "{\n",
    "       // Outer loop for the no. of rows.\n",
    "       for(int i=0;i<N;i++){\n",
    "          \n",
    "          // Inner loop for printing the alphabets from\n",
    "          // A + N -1 -i (i is row no.) to A + N -1 ( E in this case).\n",
    "          for(char ch =(char)(int)('A'+N-1-i);ch<=(char)(int)('A'+N-1);ch++){\n",
    "              \n",
    "              System.out.print(ch + \" \");\n",
    "          }\n",
    "          \n",

    "          // next row and give a line break otherwise all letters\n",
    "          // would get printed in 1 line.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down this Python implementation and explain how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We define a function `pattern19(N)` that takes an argument `N`, which represents the number of rows in each half of the butterfly pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function is divided into two main parts: the upper half and the lower half of the butterfly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Upper half:\n",
    "   - We initialize `ini_spaces = 0` to keep track of the spaces in the middle.\n",
    "   - We use a for loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (i.e., `for i in range(N)`).\n",
    "   - In each iteration:\n",
    "     a. We print `N - i` stars on the left side. This creates the decreasing pattern of stars on the left.\n",
    "     b. We print `ini_spaces` spaces in the middle.\n",
    "     c. We print `N - i` stars on the right side, mirroring the left side.\n",
    "   - After each row, we increase `ini_spaces` by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lower half:\n",
    "   - We reset `ini_spaces = 2 * N - 2`, which is the maximum number of spaces we'll need.\n",
    "   - We use another for loop that iterates from 1 to N (i.e., `for i in range(1, N + 1)`).\n",
    "   - In each iteration:\n",
    "     a. We print `i` stars on the left side. This creates the increasing pattern of stars on the left.\n",
    "     b. We print `ini_spaces` spaces in the middle.\n",
    "     c. We print `i` stars on the right side, mirroring the left side.\n",
    "   - After each row, we decrease `ini_spaces` by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use `end=''` in the `print` statements for the left stars and spaces to prevent moving to the next line after these prints, allowing us to build each line of the pattern in parts.\n",

    "#### Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization of Spaces Variable:**\n",
    "   - Original: `ini_spaces` is explicitly initialized and updated in each loop.\n",
    "   - Shortened: The number of spaces is calculated directly in the print statement (`' ' * (2 * i)` and `' ' * (2 * (N - i))`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conciseness:**\n",
    "   - Original: Uses separate print statements for stars and spaces with `end=''` to keep printing on the same line, followed by another print statement to move to the next line.\n",
    "   - Shortened: Combines stars and spaces in a single print statement for each line, making the code more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Original: Requires updating and maintaining the `ini_spaces` variable.\n",
    "   - Shortened: Eliminates the need for `ini_spaces`, directly calculating the number of spaces in the print statement, reducing the overall length and complexity of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logic Flow:**\n",
    "   - Both versions follow the same logical structure for creating the pattern but differ in how they implement it. The original version is more verbose and step-by-step, while the shortened version is more compact and efficient.\n",

    "   - `n` represents half the height of the butterfly pattern minus 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `spaces = 2 * n - 2`\n",
    "   - This initializes the variable `spaces` to `2 * n - 2`.\n",
    "   - This value represents the maximum number of spaces we'll need in the middle of the pattern.\n",
    "   - For example, if n = 5, spaces will start at 8, which is the number of spaces in the first row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for i in range(1, 2 * n):`\n",
    "   - This is the main loop that controls the entire pattern generation.\n",
    "   - It iterates from 1 to `2 * n - 1` (inclusive).\n",
    "   - This single loop handles both the upper and lower halves of the butterfly.\n",
    "   - For n = 5, this loop will run 9 times (i = 1 to 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `stars = i`\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, we start by setting `stars` equal to the current row number `i`.\n",
    "   - This works for the upper half of the pattern where the number of stars increases with each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `if i > n: stars = 2 * n - i`\n",
    "   - This conditional statement handles the lower half of the pattern.\n",
    "   - When `i` becomes greater than `n`, we're in the lower half.\n",
    "   - We calculate the number of stars for the lower half by `2 * n - i`.\n",
    "   - This creates the decreasing pattern of stars in the lower half.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `print('*' * stars, end='')`\n",
    "   - This prints the left side of the pattern.\n",
    "   - It uses string multiplication: `'*' * stars` creates a string of asterisks with length equal to `stars`.\n",
    "   - The `end=''` parameter prevents the print function from moving to a new line after printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `print(' ' * spaces, end='')`\n",
    "   - This prints the middle spaces of the pattern.\n",
    "   - Similar to the stars, it uses string multiplication to create a string of spaces.\n",
    "   - Again, `end=''` keeps the cursor on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `print('*' * stars)`\n",
    "   - This prints the right side of the pattern, mirroring the left side.\n",
    "   - We don't use `end=''` here, so it will move to a new line after printing, ready for the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `if i < n: spaces -= 2 else: spaces += 2`\n",
    "   - This adjusts the number of spaces for the next iteration.\n",

    "   - In the lower half (i >= n), we increase spaces by 2 each row.\n",
    "   - This creates the characteristic butterfly shape, narrowing towards the middle and then widening again.\n",

    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Setup\n",
    "- `spaces = 2 * n - 2`: Initializes the number of spaces between the stars on the left and right. For example, if `n = 5`, `spaces` will be 8 initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loop through Rows\n",
    "- `for i in range(1, 2 * n)`: This loop iterates from 1 to `2 * n - 1`. This is because the pattern has `2 * n - 1` rows in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determine the Number of Stars\n",
    "- `stars = i if i <= n else 2 * n - i`: \n",
    "  - For the first `n` rows, `stars = i`, which means the number of stars increases from 1 to `n`.\n",
    "  - For the next `n - 1` rows, `stars = 2 * n - i`, which means the number of stars decreases from `n` to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Printing the Pattern\n",
    "- `print('*' * stars + ' ' * spaces + '*' * stars)`: This single print statement constructs the pattern for each row:\n",
    "  - `'*' * stars`: Prints the stars on the left side.\n",
    "  - `' ' * spaces`: Prints the spaces in the middle.\n",
    "  - `'*' * stars`: Prints the stars on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusting Spaces\n",
    "- `spaces = spaces - 2 if i < n else spaces + 2`: Adjusts the number of spaces for the next row:\n",
    "  - For the first `n` rows, spaces decrease by 2.\n",
    "  - For the next `n - 1` rows, spaces increase by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to the Original Version\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Original Version\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pattern20(n):\n",
    "    spaces = 2 * n - 2\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 2 * n):\n",
    "        stars = i if i <= n else 2 * n - i\n",
    "        print('*' * stars, end='')\n",
    "        print(' ' * spaces, end='')\n",
    "        print('*' * stars)\n",
    "        if i < n:\n",
    "            spaces -= 2\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            spaces += 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the function\n",
    "print(\"For N = 5:\")\n",
    "pattern20(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nFor N = 3:\")\n",
    "pattern20(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nFor N = 6:\")\n",
    "pattern20(6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conciseness:**\n",
    "   - The shortened version combines the printing of stars and spaces into a single print statement, reducing the number of print statements and making the code more compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Space Adjustment:**\n",
    "   - The shortened version uses a ternary operator (`spaces = spaces - 2 if i < n else spaces + 2`) to adjust spaces within the loop, while the original version has a more verbose if-else structure to adjust spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How They Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Both versions work the same way:\n",
    "- They iterate through `2 * n - 1` rows.\n",
    "- For each row, they determine the number of stars to print on the left and right sides.\n",
    "- They print the stars and spaces.\n",
    "- They adjust the number of spaces for the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that the shortened version does so in a more compact manner, reducing redundancy and improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lower Half (When i > n):\n",

    "  ```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down this Python implementation and explain how it works in great detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def hollow_square(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We define a function named `hollow_square` that takes one parameter `N`. This `N` represents the size of the square (both width and height).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outer Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop iterates `N` times, representing each row of the square. The variable `i` goes from 0 to N-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inner Loop:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for j in range(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This nested loop also iterates `N` times for each row, representing each column. The variable `j` goes from 0 to N-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Condition for Printing Stars:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if i == 0 or i == N - 1 or j == 0 or j == N - 1:\n",
    "       print('*', end='')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This condition checks if we're at the border of the square:\n",
    "   - `i == 0`: First row\n",
    "   - `i == N - 1`: Last row\n",
    "   - `j == 0`: First column\n",
    "   - `j == N - 1`: Last column\n",
    "   If any of these conditions are true, we print a star ('*'). The `end=''` parameter in `print()` prevents moving to a new line after printing the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Printing Spaces:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(' ', end='')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   If we're not at the border (i.e., we're inside the square), we print a space instead of a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Moving to Next Line:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   After each row is complete (after the inner loop finishes), we call `print()` without any arguments to move to the next line, starting a new row in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works for N = 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down this Python implementation and explain how it works in great detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function Definition:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def concentric_number_pattern(N):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We define a function named `concentric_number_pattern` that takes one parameter `N`. This `N` represents the maximum number in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Size Calculation:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   size = 2 * N - 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The size of the matrix is always odd and is calculated as `2 * N - 1`. This ensures that we have a center element and symmetric sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Matrix Initialization:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   matrix = [[0 for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We create a 2D list (matrix) filled with zeros. This will be our canvas to fill in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Nested Loops:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(size):\n",
    "       for j in range(size):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These nested loops iterate over each cell in our matrix. `i` represents rows and `j` represents columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Distance Calculation:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   top = i\n",
    "   left = j\n",
    "   right = size - 1 - j\n",
    "   bottom = size - 1 - i\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   For each cell, we calculate its distance from all four edges of the matrix. This is key to determining which number should be placed in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Value Assignment:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   matrix[i][j] = N - min(min(top, bottom), min(left, right))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line is the core of the pattern generation:\n",
    "   - We find the minimum distance to any edge using `min(min(top, bottom), min(left, right))`.\n",
    "   - We subtract this minimum distance from `N` to get the value for the cell.\n",
    "   - This creates the concentric pattern, where the outermost ring is N, the next inner ring is N-1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Printing the Pattern:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for row in matrix:\n",
    "       print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We iterate over each row in the matrix, convert the numbers to strings, join them with spaces, and print each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works for N = 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initial matrix (5x5):\n",
    "[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n",
    "\n",
    "After filling (showing calculations for a few cells):\n",
    "- matrix[0][0]: N - min(min(0, 4), min(0, 4)) = 3 - min(0, 0) = 3\n",
    "- matrix[1][1]: N - min(min(1, 3), min(1, 3)) = 3 - min(1, 1) = 2\n",
    "- matrix[2][2]: N - min(min(2, 2), min(2, 2)) = 3 - min(2, 2) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Final matrix:\n",
    "[[3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n",
    " [3, 2, 2, 2, 3],\n",
    " [3, 2, 1, 2, 3],\n",
    " [3, 2, 2, 2, 3],\n",
    " [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For N = 6, the process is similar but with a larger 11x11 matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is elegant and efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It uses a single pass through the matrix to generate the entire pattern.\n",
    "2. The algorithm is based on the geometric property that the value in each cell is determined by its distance from the nearest edge.\n",
    "3. It's highly flexible - changing N produces larger or smaller patterns with the same concentric structure.\n",
    "4. The code is concise yet produces a complex pattern, demonstrating the power of mathematical thinking in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern generator showcases several important programming concepts:\n",
    "- 2D list manipulation\n",
    "- Nested loops for grid traversal\n",
    "- Mathematical pattern recognition and implementation\n",
    "- Efficient algorithm design (O(n^2) complexity, which is optimal for this problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this solution lies in how it translates a visual pattern into a mathematical formula, and then into code. It's a great example of the intersection of mathematics and computer science in creating visually interesting patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a shorter version of the `concentric_number_pattern` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def concentric_number_pattern(N):\n",
    "    size = 2 * N - 1\n",
    "    for i in range(size):\n",
    "        row = [N - min(i, size - 1 - i, j, size - 1 - j) for j in range(size)]\n",

    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nFor N = 6:\")\n",
    "concentric_number_pattern(6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Size Calculation:**\n",
    "   - `size = 2 * N - 1` determines the dimensions of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating through Rows:**\n",
    "   - `for i in range(size):` iterates through each row index.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Nested Loops**: A loop inside another loop. Often used for multidimensional data structures or complex patterns.\n",
    "   - **Outer Loop**: Controls the number of rows.\n",
    "   - **Inner Loop**: Controls the number of columns or characters per row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Print Statements**: Used to output characters to the console.\n",
    "   - `print(\"*\")`: Prints a star followed by a newline.\n",

    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop Control**: Understanding how loops work and how to control them is essential for creating patterns.\n",
    "2. **Spacing and Alignment**: Proper spacing and alignment are crucial for patterns, especially for centered or pyramid shapes.\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: Although star patterns are simple, it's still good practice to consider the efficiency of your code, especially with larger patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Star patterns are a great way to practice and understand the fundamentals of loops and control structures in Python. By experimenting with different patterns, you can improve your problem-solving skills and your ability to think algorithmically. These exercises also serve as a stepping stone to more complex algorithmic challenges."
